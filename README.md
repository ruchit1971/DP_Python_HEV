# DP_Python_HEV
 Dynamic Programming Optimization of Hybrid Vehicle Fuel Consumption
 
 
1. Main Assignment information:
A hybrid vehicle has various possibilities of configurations. The parallel vehicle is the 
well known concepts. The parallel hybrid has a mechanical link (via transmission) from the combustion 
engine to the wheels. 
This means that for the parallel hybrid
only the state of charge is optimized.
The models for the parallel, should be formulated
so that the cost for following an arc in the optimal control problem can be
calculated.
